Movie Site
----------------
authors: Kevin Quinn and Udacity

media_centre.py = Main program file
fresh-tomatoes = website script (from Udacity)
media.py = data structures for movies

To run the site, have python installed on your machine and since it is an executable thanks to the shebang(#!) notation, type "chmod +x media_centre.py"(to give it permission to run)  and then  "./media_centre.py" into the command prompt.  It will give the option to use preexisting movies in the list or to add your own set.  Once done, it will open a new browser window with the website and all of the movies.
