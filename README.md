Repo to hold the projects we will be covering using the Odin Project and various other online courses.  This seems a lot cleaner than having 50 repos of tiny projects.

-> Udacity folder: github student pack has a free month of a nanodegree, using it for the full stack web developer nanodegree.  All projects, big or small, will go in this folder
